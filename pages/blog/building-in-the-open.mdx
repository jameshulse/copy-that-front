# Why I'm Building in the Open

## tl;dr: It's fun

I've been running my [newsletter](https://copythat.io/newsletter), Copy That, for a little while now. However, it was always secretly my plan to make it into something bigger. So, today, I'm taking the first few steps towards launching the new, app-version of Copy That.

I say 'first few steps' because I'm going to be building the site in a somewhat unconventional way. If you're reading this post at the time of launch, you may have noticed that the site is missing a few bits. I wouldn't go as far to say that this lack of features is *intentional*, but I do want to be prioritising, perhaps to an extreme extent, shipping early and shipping openly.

As well as shipping early, building openly means that:

- You can find all the code for the site on GitHub [(front](https://github.com/mulholio/copy-that-front) and [back](https://github.com/mulholio/copy-that-back))
- I will be blogging as I go on decision-making processes, technical challenges, how to make the site look fun.
- I will be [tweeting](https://twitter.com/mulholio) about my progress
- I will be [streaming](http://twitch.com/mulholio) on Twitch

Why do this? Why go to the extra effort of documenting and sharing my work like this? Why not just focus on a good product?

As I see it, I there are four reasons for shipping openly:

1. Accountability
2. Learning
3. Direction
4. Marketing

It feels somewhat disingenuous to put it into a categorised list like this as I essentially want to start building more openly *because it's fun.* When you have the relatively mono-directional format of a newsletter, it's a little bit difficult to know what people are thinking and I wanted to make this less about me coding by myself in my room and more about the value I can deliver for other people.

That said, on to the categorised list!

## 1. Building In the Open Keeps You Accountable

It's a common pattern for programmers to start a lot of projects that never get finished. I checked my own `proj` folder on my laptop and saw that I have 64 repos in there. Now, not all of them are projects in the way that this site is, but there are, nevertheless, a lot of things in there that make me think 'what happened to that?'

I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thingâ€“sometimes you need a quick app just to get your head round a technologyâ€“but ten projects at 50% completion is worth far less than a couple of projects at 100% completion.

Part of the reason I'll be building Copy That in the open is so that I have some social pressure to keep it up. I'm generally quite motivated, but I like idea the added worry of users that I need to continue to support. After running the newsletter for a little while now, I've begun to have people tell me that they enjoyed the last edition, or send me little bits of code they've written. I don't care about doing something just for the sake of appearances, but I do care about improving something that I know people are getting value out of.

## 2. Building Openly Lets You Lean Faster

If there's one thing I love about being a software engineer, it's that you get to see collective intelligence. Being able to go to StackOverflow and have a complete stranger answer my question and then add that to the collective intelligence of the internet is a truly mind-boggling thing. I want that same feeling when building Copy That.

The benefits of this are super clear. Why work stuff out if other people have already? Even before launching, I started to get help from strangers on the internet (see tweets below) and if I can get people more knowledgeable than myself to answer my questions, then I'm going to seize that opportunity.

`}/>

I'd love for this to be a two way process too. Copy That is as much (if not more) about sharing what I am doing with others as it is about me learning from them and the idea that other people will learn from my code and posts is appealing.

## 3. Building Openly Gives You Direction

In a related note, showing everyone what you are doing means you can get feedback and iterate on it.

Shipping in the open means that you're open about your mistakes and not having things perfect straight away. But it also means that you can make sure you're building the right thing, not just building the wrong thing well.

None of this is to say that I'm going to be sloppy. The idea isn't that I rush things, don't think them through, and leave it at that. Rather, the idea is to be iterative. You make a first pass at what you want to get done, you get it out there and then you improve.

So if you have feedback, [I'd love to here it](mailto:james@copythat.io). Otherwise, pop back here soon and see what's changed.

## 4. Building Openly is Good Marketing

I was reluctant to call what I'm doing 'marketing' at first. A) because I'm not very good at marketing and the suggestion that I am being overly strategic about this makes me uncomfortable and B) because my marketing is just going to be to put out interesting stuff and hope people notice (e.g. this blog post).

However, if my goal is to provide the most value to the most users over time, it will help if people see what I'm building, and sharing everything will ensure that happens.

Speaking of which (ðŸ˜‰) if you haven't signed up already, you can sign up for the Copy That newsletter here. My form isn't that pretty at the moment, but that's okay: at least I have one.
