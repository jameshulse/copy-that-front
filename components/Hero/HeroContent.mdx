## What is Copy That?

Copy That is a free, weekly newsletter that sends you interesting designs from across the internet to inspire you and let you practice on.

## Work in Progress

I'm currently in the process of converting the idea from a newsletter to a fully fledged site so that you can be inspired on demand, not just once a week.

If you're interested in finding more about the project, [sign up to the newsletter](https://pages.convertkit.com/901126d022/14dd00220e) or head over to the [blog](/blog).
